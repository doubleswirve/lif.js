- [ ] router?
- [ ] lifecycle stuff and how to handle removing custom event listeners?
- [ ] make stateful state be "observable" for debugging
- [ ] testing setup
- [ ] should store/state force a return value? or just use `setState`?
- [ ] should we remove `dom.js` wrap? since `lit-html` offers way more w/ directives?
